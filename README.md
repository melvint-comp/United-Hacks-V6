### Overview

**Resonance** is an ambitious platform designed to measure, understand, and improve the quality of human interactions across digital environments. While most technology optimizes productivity and efficiency, Resonance focuses on something more fundamental: how humans communicate, feel heard, and connect with one another.

*This repository contains Phase 0 of Resonance - a minimal, open-source interaction analysis engine intended to scale into a much larger system.*

### The Problem
Modern communication tools often:

    - Optimize speed, not empathy
    - Amplify misunderstandings
    - Ignore emotional and cultural context
    - Provide no feedback on how we interact

Yet interaction quality directly affects:

    - Mental Health
    - Team Performance
    - Education
    - Relationships
    - Global Collaboration
    - And much more of our lives.

---

### The Vision

Resonance aims to become a universal interaction layer that can be embedded into:

    - Messaging platforms
    - Video conferencing tools
    - Educational systems
    - Workplace collaboration software
    - Mental health and coaching tools

In the long term, Resonance will:

    - Analyze conversations in real time
    - Provide empathy-aware feedback
    - Adapt across cultures and contexts
    - Help humans communicate, not just more, but better

### In This Hackathon (Phase 0)

This repository implements:

##### Interaction Analysis Engine (Prototype)
    - Emotional tone detection
    - Speaking balance estimation
    - Empathy signal heuristics

##### Minimal Web Demo
    - Paste a conversation
    - Receive an interaction quality report

##### Extensible API Design
    Built to support future modalities:
    - Voice
    - Video
    - Live meetings
    - Multilingual conversations

*This is not a finished product - it is the foundation of a much larger system.*

---

### Architecture (Scalability and Deployment)
Resonance is designed as a modular system:

    - Core analysis engine
    - Pluggable interaction models
    - Frontend-agnostic API
    - Privacy-first by design

*See [docs/architecture.md](/docs/architecture.md)*

---

### Roadmap (Beyond this Hackathon)
    Phase 1: Voice & meeting analysis
    Phase 2: Real-time feedback loops
    Phase 3: Cultural & neurodiversity models
    Phase 4: Developer SDK & integrations
    Phase 5: Open interaction benchmarks

*See [docs/roadmap.md](/docs/roadmap.md)*

---

### Ethics & Responsibility
*Human interaction data is sensitive.*

Resonance is built with:

    - Transparency
    - Consent-first analysis
    - No surveillance use cases
    - Open discussion on ethical boundaries

*See [docs/ethics.md](/docs/ethics.md)*

---

###### Resonance tackles *a deeply human problem, across cultures, platforms, and contexts, at a global scale.* This hackathon version proves feasibility, not completeness.
